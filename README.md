# Simple Block chain Implementation

I implemented block chain using python3.7 to gain a basic knowledge of how it works

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
-Python 3.6+
-Flask
-pip
-Postman (terminal cal also work)
```

### Installing

I made the project on Pycharm so you just need to open the project

```
$ python blockchain.py
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

these are the app routes I created

```
/chain
/transactions/new
/mine
/nodes/register
/nodes/resolve
```
